# djArduino
Project for an Exploring Computer Science Workshop for High School students visiting SCC. 

[Here is the slide show that steps the students through the project.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wF1Y_anjsnvhXFXIhkUhFcJOAmg51184QS4Gwxb7q_8/edit?usp=sharing)

The code provided in this repository is for the finished jukebox which we didn't have time for in the workshop, but was the goal of and inspiration for the workshop. The pitches.h file and starter code is from the [Arduino repository](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ToneMelody).

The idea is that the arduino is running the pickAsong code while the PC it is attached to (not hard to change to Mac or Linux see comments) is running the twitter_pc.py which reads a twitter feed and plays a requested song.
